# Columbia University COVID-19 Design Challenge
We are a team of Columbia University undergraduates aiming to produce a viable design concept toward the development of an interdisciplinary technology-driven solution that could be used to support the COVID-19 response effort. More information about the design challenge can be found [here](https://entrepreneurship.engineering.columbia.edu/design-challenge-covid-19/).
